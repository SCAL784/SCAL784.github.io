<div style="text-align: left;">The purpose of this site is
to locate and mark all veteran graves in Schuyler County. While a
simple thought was born, this project has taken on a life and size of
its own. We are now at the point where we need your help with more
information. Many of the known cemeteries in the county have been found
and veterans so noted on our records. We know we have missed many
cemeteries and graves and now ask for your help. Your tidbits of your
information can fill in lots of little holes on this undertaking.<br>
<br>
While viewing a cemetery listing, it was our thought to list entries by
row and plot. Both numbers are ambigous as rows waver and areas with no
or future plots give for strange numbering. If you know a particular
cemetery better than us, please do send your thoughts and better
row/plot numbers so we can update. The information is only there to
help us get close and find our fellow veterans.<br>
<br>
Finally, after this process was started, we went back and started
adding War Era and any othere information. We have yet to go back over
the earlier cemeteries, but we will get there. Again your info is
appreciated.<br>
